# PromptPath – AI-Driven Interactive Prompt Optimizer  

## Overview  
**PromptPath** is an AI-powered assistant designed to help users craft high-quality prompts for AI models such as **ChatGPT, MidJourney, and Stable Diffusion**. It enhances prompts with real-time AI feedback, model-specific optimizations, and a community-driven prompt library.  

## Features  
-  **AI-based prompt enhancement** for clarity and specificity  
-  **Model-specific optimizations** for GPT, MidJourney, and Stable Diffusion  
-  **Interactive AI feedback** to refine prompts in real-time  
-  **Performance analyzer** to compare prompt versions  
-  **Community library** for sharing and ranking prompts  

##  Technology Stack  

### **Frontend**  
- **React (Next.js)** – Web application  
- **Flutter** (Future mobile app development)  

### **Backend**  
- **Node.js (Express.js) with TypeScript** – API development  
- **Redis** – Caching for real-time optimizations  
- **GraphQL / REST API** – AI interactions and data retrieval  

### **Database**  
- **PostgreSQL** – User data, prompt history, and rankings  
- **Supabase / Firebase** – Alternative backend services  

### **AI Processing**  
- **OpenAI API** – Natural language processing and prompt optimization  
- **Vector Search (Weaviate / Pinecone)** – Efficient prompt retrieval  

### **Deployment**
